The proposal is clear. However you should have taken into account the mandatory requirements such as register (public part), and edit the profile 
in the private part. Check this. Regarding the functionality, for instance the reviews can be created, but can they be modified or deleted? the
CRUD operations sould be clear. 
In the readme the names of the members of the group should appear, as well as the coordinator should be indicated.
The project created and the issues are ok. Keep on the good work.
